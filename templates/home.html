      <h2>What Is Skin Cancer</h2>
      <p>Skin cancer is cancer that begins in skin cells and typically causes unusual growth or changes. Some types of skin cancer can spread to other parts of the body.

        Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. It occurs when there is an irregular growth of skin cells. The cells are also how physicians identify the type of skin cancer.
        
        The best way to understand skin cancer is to understand its different types and how they affect the body.

      <h2>Determining the Extent of Skin Cancer</h2>
      <p>Determining the extent of skin cancer, known as staging, is crucial for treatment and prognosis. It involves
        assessing how far the cancer has spread within the skin and to other parts of the body.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clinical Examination:</strong> Doctors visually examine the tumor, checking its size, depth, and
          whether it has ulcerated.</li>
        <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> A sample of the tumor is taken to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate its depth
          (thickness).</li>
        <li><strong>Imaging Tests:</strong> For more advanced cases, imaging like CT scans, MRIs, or PET scans may be
          done to detect spread to lymph nodes or other organs.</li>
        <li><strong>Lymph Node Evaluation:</strong> If there's a concern the cancer has spread, a sentinel lymph node
          biopsy is often performed to check the nearest lymph nodes for cancer cells.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The stage of skin cancer, ranging from Stage 0 (localized) to Stage IV (spread to distant organs), helps guide
        treatment decisions, which may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy.</p>

        <h2>What You Need for a Skin Self-Exam</h2>
        <p>The best time to check your own skin is after a bath or shower. Here’s what you’ll need to do a skin
          self-exam that is as thorough as possible at home:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A well-lit room:</strong> Proper lighting helps you see any changes clearly.</li>
          <li><strong>A full-length mirror:</strong> Allows you to examine large areas of your body.</li>
          <li><strong>A hand-held mirror:</strong> Helps check areas that are hard to see.</li>
          <li><strong>A spouse, partner, or close friend:</strong> They can assist with examining hard-to-see areas like
            your back or scalp.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The First Time You Check Your Skin at Home:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Spend time carefully going over the entire surface of your skin.</li>
          <li>Learn the pattern of moles, blemishes, freckles, and other marks so that you’ll notice any changes next
            time.</li>
          <li>Be sure to show your doctor any areas that concern you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skin Self-Exam Steps</h2>
        <p>Follow these step-by-step instructions to examine your skin at home:</p>
        

        <div class="exam-step">
          <h3>Face the Mirror</h3>
          <img src="/static/images/face-mirror.png"
            alt="Man facing mirror, checking face, ears, neck, chest, and belly">
          <p>Check your face, ears, neck, chest, and belly. Women will need to lift their breasts to check the skin
            underneath.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-step">
          <img src="/static/images/arms-hands.png" alt="Man checking underarm, arms, hands, and fingernails">
          <p>Check your underarm areas, both sides of your arms, the tops and palms of your hands, in between your
            fingers, and under your fingernails.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-step">
          <h3>Sit Down</h3>
          <img src="/static/images/legs-feet.png"
            alt="Man sitting and checking thighs, shins, feet, toes, and toenails">
          <p>Check the front of your thighs, shins, tops of your feet, in between your toes, and under your toenails.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-step">
          <img src="/static/images/bottoms-feet.png"
            alt="Man using a mirror to check the bottoms of feet, calves, and thighs">
          <p>Now use a hand mirror to look at the bottoms of your feet, your calves, and the backs of your thighs, first
            checking one leg and then the other.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-step">
          <img src="/static/images/back-check.png"
            alt="Man using a mirror to check back, buttocks, genital area, and neck">
          <p>Use the hand mirror to check your buttocks, genital area, lower and upper back, and the back of your neck
            and ears. Or it may be easier to look at your back in the wall mirror using a hand mirror.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exam-step">
          <img src="/static/images/scalp-check.png" alt="Man using a comb to check scalp">
          <p>Use a comb or hair dryer to part your hair so that you can check your scalp.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <h2>What Should I Look For?</h2>
          <p>Check any moles, blemishes, or birthmarks from the top of your head to your toes. If you look at your skin
            regularly, you will know what’s normal for you.</p>

          <p>Many skin cancers are found on parts of the body that get more sun, such as the face, head, neck, and arms.
            However, skin cancer can appear anywhere on the body.</p>

          <p>Not all skin cancers look the same, and they can appear in various shapes and sizes. Some may resemble
            non-cancerous skin conditions.</p>

          <h3>Common Signs of Skin Cancer</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A new, expanding, or changing growth, spot, or bump on the skin</li>
            <li>A sore that bleeds and/or doesn’t heal after several weeks</li>
            <li>A rough or scaly red patch, which might crust or bleed</li>
            <li>A wart-like growth</li>
            <li>A mole (or other spot) that’s new or changing in size, shape, or color</li>
            <li>A mole with an odd shape, irregular borders, or areas of different colors</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It’s important to understand that these are not the only ways skin cancer can appear. If you notice any
            unusual changes in your skin, consult a doctor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>If You Find Something Suspicious on Your Skin</h2>
          <p>Whether you’re doing a skin self-exam or just looking at your skin at any time, you might notice something
            that has just appeared or that has recently changed.</p>

          <p>Maybe it’s a mole that looks new or different. Maybe it’s an area that’s dry and scaly and keeps coming
            back.</p>

          <p>No matter what you notice when you’re looking at your skin, if you see anything that concerns you, be sure
            to have it checked by a doctor.</p>

              With the Skin Cancer Detection web app, you can immediately detect signs of the most common types of skin
              cancer, but it is not a diagnosis.
              Early detection is critical in skin cancer treatment and is one of the greatest challenges of modern
              dermatology,
              posing significant risk to your health and life.
              The sooner you detect a potential risk and get in touch with your doctor, the higher the chance you will avoid
              the worst outcome.
              If you detect a sign of skin cancer using the Skin Cancer Detection service,
              we advise you to visit a doctor, who can make a definite diagnosis if you need to be treated for skin cancer.

              Most cancers have some pretty obvious signs,
              including lumps and bumps, tenderness, pain or sickness.
              But when it comes to skin cancer symptoms, they aren't always as plain to see.
              Skin cancer is slow-growing and often free of glaring warning signs.
              This can make early detection tricky.

              While for many of us moles are just brown spots on our body we may not pay much attention to,
              they come in various shapes, sizes, and forms that can tell us important things about our skin health.
              Understanding all types of skin moles helps us identify any suspicious spots for skin cancer and keep our skin
              healthy.
