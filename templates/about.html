        <h3>General Information About Skin Cancer</h3>
        <p>Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.</p>
        <p>Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.</p>
        <p>Different factors increase or decrease the risk of skin cancer.</p>

        <h3>Types of Skin Cancer</h3>
        <p>There are two main types of skin cancer:</p>
        <p>Nonmelanoma, also called keratinocyte carcinoma, includes squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma.</p>
        <p>Melanoma is more likely to spread and harder to cure if not detected early.</p>

        <h3>Skin Cancer Screening</h3>
        <p>Screening for skin cancer may include examination by both the patient and the health care provider.</p>
        <p>Regular self-examinations and dermatologist check-ups are important.</p>
        <p>If an area on the skin looks abnormal, a biopsy is usually done.</p>

        <h3>Risks of Skin Cancer Screening</h3>
        <p>Finding skin cancer does not always improve health or help you live longer.</p>
        <p>False-negative test results can give a false sense of security.</p>
        <p>False-positive test results can lead to unnecessary tests and anxiety.</p>
        <p>Biopsies may cause scarring or infection.</p>

        <p>Talk to your doctor about your risk for skin cancer and your need for screening tests.</p>
